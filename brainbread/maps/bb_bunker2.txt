               --- BRAINBREAD --- UN-OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN ---
                          --- The Bunker ---

After fighting your way through the town you follow the marines to 
what was one of the last safe locations nearby.  Upon entering, the 
sounds of gunfire echoing from within the old decommissioned 
military bunker proved otherwise.  Luckily, there is a small cache 
of ammunition and a few firearms still left near the entrance.  In 
the event that the installation is compromised; you been informed 
that there’s an adjoining section to the bunker that is used to 
house and maintain a large nuclear reactor as well as the personnel 
quarters.  If you help the marines fend off the zombies, they will 
help you escape the infested section of the bunker and escape into 
the other more secure section.  The following are your objectives:

A.)	The zombies have overrun the access road leading into the 
garage area of the bunker.  Help the marines fend off the waves of 
zombies until you are given new orders.
B.)	The bunker has suffered a few structural failures, which 
had earlier knocked out the main power.  The marines had sent out 
a team to start up the back-up generators.  While the generators 
are now operational, all contact with the team has been lost and 
a power breaker needs to be reset.  It is your job to venture 
farther into the bunker and reset the breaker.
C.)	Chose the path that you will take to the garage area, but 
while on your way; you must eliminate as many zombies as the 
military requests.
D.)	Eliminate the mutated zombie that has been found in 
the garage.
E.)	Make your way down the access corridor.  The marines and 
local security guards will be waiting to assist you once you 
make it to the access door.
