=== STORY ====\\

You and a handful of other civilians have been dropped off at a
seemingly small military base, at least above ground.  Below the
ground is an expansive military installation where research on
the undead had been going on.  Recently, the base had been
compromised.  The security guards and solders are doing their best
to fend off the zombies and evacuate anyone else still alive
in the base, but they still need to recover the research that had
been going on down there.  Since they are spread thin, you and a
few others volunteered to recover the research materials.

=== Good Luck! ====//
