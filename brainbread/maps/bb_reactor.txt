=== STORY ====\\

You along with a handful of civilians manage to survive the journey 
through the zombie-infested sections of the bunker by manually 
opening the blast doors sealing you and your companions off from 
safety, or so you thought. As soon as you managed to open up the 
blast doors leading to the personnel section, a handful of marines 
and a security guard rush over to fend off the persistent zombies. 
Unfortunately, the lengthy ordeal has taken up virtually all the 
ammunition that you were carrying as well as the ammunition 
reserves of the others with you. With an ever growing number of zombies 
approaching, you and those without a gun or ammunition were rushed 
into access corridor while the marines attempted to close and 
secure the blast doors. Just as the zombies were about to overtake 
the marines, the doors of the access corridor slammed shut 
separating you and those in the corridor from the marines. Unable 
to open the access doors, you and the other surviving civilians 
must now venture into the rest of the compound virtually unarmed. 
Hopefully, the marines left behind some weapons and ammunition in 
the foyer as the doors leading directly to the personnel quarters 
won’t open either.

=== Good Luck! ====//
