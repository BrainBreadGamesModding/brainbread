All you need to do is extract this file (Which you already did), and move it into your hl folder. (move the brainbread folder that came out of the .rar, and move that to steam>balbalb>balbabl>half-life

It will ask to overwrite, let it, and the files are in. Done. Bam. Narf. Play. (The .res file is for server hosters only, if you REALLY need those kb, just delete it unless you intend to host it.)
